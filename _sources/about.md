# About the Project

Computer vision a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs. In this project, I will use tensorflow for tasks related to to image recognition, starting from the basic digit recognition `Hello World` example. 

I write hands-on projects on deep learning here. You can also see other articles I wrote on Medium [blog](https://medium.com/@gabegaz).

If you have comments or issues with codes, you can open an issues [here](https://github.com/gabegaz/images/issues). You can also contact me [here](https://www.gabegaz.com/resume/).
