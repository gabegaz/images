    "# Digit Recognition with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this article, we will dive into undertanding how a basic neural network works to recognize digits using the _MNIST_ data set with a Python library Keras/Tensorflow. A digit recogniztion problem with keras is a problem where a deep learning model is trained to identify whether a digit put in an image is one of the numbers (say between 0 and 9). This simple exercise is fundamental to doing bigger machine learning projects such as image recogniton or object recogntion where these later assignments need a more advanced form the network we are training here. Potential applications of such more advanced neural network training is in the area of manufacturing (detection of product defects), self-driving vehicles, security (facial recognition), detecting disease in the health care industry etc."
